What are you expected to know? Basic R objects and methods tidyverse packages and syntax i.e. ggplot2, dplyr, readr, tidyr, the pipe operator %&gt;% If these are new, don’t sweat it - google them, we’ll talk through them as we go if needed This portion of workshop expectation no expectation of experience with spatial in R - we’ll cover all the basics What is R and why should we use R for spatial analysis? Let’s break that into two questions - first, what is R and why should we use it? A language and environment for statistical computing and graphics R is lightweight, free, open-source and cross-platform Works with contributed packages - currently 12,938 -extensibility Automation and recording of workflow (reproducibility) Optimized work flow - data manipulation, analysis and visualization all in one place R does not alter underlying data - manipulation and visualization in memory R is great for repetetive graphics Figure 1.1: History of R 1.1 Workshop agenda 1.2 Spatial Data in R 1.3 Code along Just a sampling of what we’ll cover. Run code, examine output, ask any questions - we’ll explore it all in more detail through the morning. 1.3.1 geocoding example with tmaptools using open street map # uses OSM library(tmap) library(tmaptools) library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union tex_cap &lt;-tmaptools::geocode_OSM(&quot;Texas Capital&quot;, as.sf = TRUE) %&gt;% glimpse() ## Observations: 1 ## Variables: 8 ## $ query &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Texas Capital&quot; ## $ lat &lt;dbl&gt; -31.46748 ## $ lon &lt;dbl&gt; -64.22844 ## $ lat_min &lt;dbl&gt; -31.46748 ## $ lat_max &lt;dbl&gt; -31.46748 ## $ lon_min &lt;dbl&gt; -64.22995 ## $ lon_max &lt;dbl&gt; -64.22723 ## $ geometry &lt;POINT [°]&gt; POINT (-64.22844 -31.46748) 1.3.2 interactive mapping library(mapview) mapview(tex_cap) 1.3.3 Choropleth map The package maps (automatically installed and loaded with ggplot2) provides maps of the USA, with state and county borders, that can be retrieved and converted as sf objects: library(sf) ## Linking to GEOS 3.6.1, GDAL 2.2.3, PROJ 4.9.3 library(maps) counties &lt;- st_as_sf(map(&quot;county&quot;, plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE)) counties &lt;- subset(counties, grepl(&quot;texas&quot;, counties$ID) &amp; !grepl(&#39;missouri,texas&#39;,counties$ID)) counties$area &lt;- as.numeric(st_area(counties)) head(counties) ## Simple feature collection with 6 features and 2 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: -103.0751 ymin: 28.14942 xmax: -94.13123 ymax: 37.00161 ## epsg (SRID): 4326 ## proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ## geometry ID area ## 2168 MULTIPOLYGON (((-101.6255 3... oklahoma,texas 5434507068 ## 2491 MULTIPOLYGON (((-95.75271 3... texas,anderson 2817584981 ## 2492 MULTIPOLYGON (((-102.2042 3... texas,andrews 3962852909 ## 2493 MULTIPOLYGON (((-94.13123 3... texas,angelina 2200352194 ## 2494 MULTIPOLYGON (((-96.80122 2... texas,aransas 290370313 ## 2495 MULTIPOLYGON (((-98.42269 3... texas,archer 2422607253 tm_shape(counties) + tm_polygons(&quot;area&quot;, style=&quot;quantile&quot;, title=&quot;Texas Counties Area&quot;) 1.4 Challenge: Does this work?
