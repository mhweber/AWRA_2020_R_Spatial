You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #.

What are you expected to know? Basic R objects and methods tidyverse packages and syntax i.e. ggplot2, dplyr, readr, tidyr, the pipe operator %&gt;% If these are new, don’t sweat it - google them, we’ll talk through them as we go if needed This portion of workshop expectation no expectation of experience with spatial in R - we’ll cover all the basics What is R and why should we use R for spatial analysis? Let’s break that into two questions - first, what is R and why should we use it? A language and environment for statistical computing and graphics R is lightweight, free, open-source and cross-platform Works with contributed packages - currently 12,938 -extensibility Automation and recording of workflow (reproducibility) Optimized work flow - data manipulation, analysis and visualization all in one place R does not alter underlying data - manipulation and visualization in memory R is great for repetetive graphics Figure 2.1: History of R 2.1 Workshop agenda 2.2 Spatial Data in R 2.3 Code along Just a sampling of what we’ll cover.
