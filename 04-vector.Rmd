# Vector data with `sf`

```{r, fig.cap="Sticky geometry with `sf`", echo=FALSE, out.width="150%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Sticky.png")
```

- `sf` makes use of a couple key libraries that are the foundation for most open source geospatial software
```{r, fig.cap="Source: https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2020/03/17/wkt.html ", echo=FALSE, out.width="150%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sf_deps.png")
```

- Talk about the difference between `st_read` and `read_sf`.  `read_sf` uses `tidyverse`-style defaults:
  * `quiet = TRUE`
  * `as_tibble` = TRUE
  * `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`

- Mention units in sf...

You can read many different vector data types (through `gdal`):
- ESRI Shapefiles
- Geopackages
- Geojson
- ESRI File Geodatabases
- PostGIS databases
- ...

We can easily see which drivers and how many are available to `sf` through `gdal`:
```{r st_drivers}
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
print(paste0('There are ',st_drivers("vector") %>% nrow(), ' vector drivers available using st_read or read_sf'))
print('They are the following: ')
print(st_drivers("vector") %>% dplyr::select(FullName = long_name))
```
  

Load `tidycensus` - you'll need to set your Census API key. A key can be obtained from [here](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).
```{r}
library(sf)
library(tidycensus)
# census_api_key("YOUR API KEY GOES HERE")
```

```{r}
library(tidycensus)
library(ggplot2)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
austin_tracts <- get_acs(state = 'TX', county = 'Travis', geography = "tract",
                         variables = "B19013_001", geometry = TRUE)

austin_tracts %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = estimate)) + 
  geom_sf(color = NA) + 
  coord_sf(crs = 26911) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma") 
```

### Challenge: Chained spatial operation {.challenge}

Earlier we showed example of printing and storing a statement using parens
```{r}
(file <- system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package='sf'))
```

How would we read this file into an `sf` data frame using chained operation?

### Answer {.solution} 

```{r}
(file %>% read_sf() -> nc)
```

A question to use on a spatial tibble - What type of object is ''?  If you `run head()` does it behave the way you're used to seeing `head` function?  How might you get the behavior you're used to seeing from `head` with ''
