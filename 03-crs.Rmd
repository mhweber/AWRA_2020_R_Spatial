# Coordinate reference systems

- Lesson Objectives
  
  + Describe and understand a `CRS` in R and components of a `CRS`

  
A `CRS` is made up of several components:

- **Coordinate system**: The x,y grid that defines where your data lies in space
- **Horizontal and vertical units**: The units describing grid along the x,y and possibly z axes
- **Datum**: The modeled version of the shape of the earth
- **Projection details**: If projected, the mathematical equation used to flatten objects from round surface (earth) to flat surface (paper or screen)

- There is no 'on-the-fly' projection in R - you need to make sure you specify the CRS of your objects, and CRS needs to match for any spatial operations or you'll get an error

- [spatialreference.org](https://spatialreference.org/) is your friend in R - chances are you will use it frequently working with spatial data in R.

- Useful `rgdal` package functions:
  + projInfo(type='datum')
  + projInfo(type='ellps')
  + projInfo(type='proj')
